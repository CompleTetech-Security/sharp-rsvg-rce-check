## One exploit, one repository

| Field | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Exploit identifier | `CVE-2026-96889` |
| Aliases for this same exploit | `GHSA-wq5f-xc86-pv6w` |
| Research verification date | 2026-10-23 |
| Implementation state | `planned` |
| Detection rule | **Disabled — research only** |

This repository is dedicated to **CVE-2026-96889**. Aliases and multiple affected
products identify this same exploit; they do not create additional scanner scopes.
Future fixes for different vulnerabilities belong in independent repositories.

## Advisory snapshot

The following is source-backed research for implementation planning. It is not a
test result, a live rule feed, or an attestation that a deployed system is patched.

### Affected versions or conditions

<0.35.5

### Reported fixes or remediation

0.35.5

### Deployment preconditions to establish

- glibc Linux for documented RCE conditions
- SVG decoding
- runtime hardening including Node PIE status
- untrusted SVG reaches decoder

### Evidence notes and limitations

- Global librsvg overrides need independent version evidence. Blocking VipsForeignLoadSvg mitigates SVG decoding; PIE mitigates RCE but does not establish library patch state. Unknown libc/PIE stays unknown.

## Planned checker behavior

The intended checker follows the evidence and reporting conventions of
[node2shell-check](https://github.com/CompleteTech-LLC/node2shell-check) and [php2shell-check](https://github.com/CompleteTech-LLC/php2shell-check):

- Prefer offline version, inventory, or configuration evidence appropriate to this exploit.
- Keep version state, documented preconditions, evidence provenance, and uncertainty separate.
- Preserve `exploitability: not_tested`; never run exploit payloads or confirm compromise.
- Keep missing, malformed, conflicting, vendor-qualified, prerelease, and uncovered versions `unknown`.
- Produce human-readable findings and machine-readable JSON/CSV; document each output before release.
- Add bounded, explicitly selected passive network behavior only if it provides useful evidence.

These capabilities are **planned**, not implemented. There are currently no
checker commands, downloadable binaries, test results, or CI claims.
